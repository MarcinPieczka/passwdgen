# passwdgen
## secure password generator 
passwords are generated by 10000 times hashing the master key and domain with sha256

## in nice format
passwords are allways 16 characters, allways contain at least one digit, one upper and one lower case letter

## to do
to prevent user misteakes, hash of master key needs to be stored(milion sha256?)
